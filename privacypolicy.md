This policy applies to all information collected or submitted in the Worth It? app for iPhone.

### Information we collect

#### Ads and analytics

The app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as duration of activity tracked, to improve the app.

No personal data is used to target ads. The app uses AdMob to serve ads and any collection of data they do would be subject to their privacy policy.

### Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve the app - that's it! We do not share or sell your information to 3rd parties.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.


### California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

### Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information in our app from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our app is structured to attract anyone under 13.

### International Transfers of Information

Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

### Your Consent
