## Worth It?

When doing work we often wonder if the time we're spending is "worth it" for the outcome at the end. 

Worth It lets you compare the cost of your time against a host of common consumer products & services. 

Was the meeting you and fifteen of your collegues just had really worth 4 Apple Watches? How about the hour you spent finding just the right shade of blue for the exeutive presentation - was that worth a year of Netflix? 

We think you'll be surprised just how much your time is worth!
